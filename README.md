Supervised Learning - Classification
Implement the Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbours algorithms from scratch in Python using Numpy and Pandas and Matplotlib for visualization.

The algorithm must be implemented as a function with arguments, x_train (the features) and y_train (the output).  Usage of any library that has an implementation is forbidden.

The code must be uploaded to the portal and GitHub and be in Python Notebook format (.ipynb file). The GitHub link is to be attached. The repository has to be open.

Evaluation will be done on the code formatting, the final accuracy results, and small explanations of any data preprocessing done (data preprocessing and visualization has bonus points). The explanations must also be included in the same python notebook which can be done using markdown cells.

The Python version to be used must be above 3.5.

Supervised Learning - Regression
Implement the Linear Regression algorithm from scratch in Python using Numpy and Pandas and Matplotlib for visualization.

The algorithm must be implemented as a function with arguments, x_train (the features) and y_train (the output).  Usage of any library that has an implementation is forbidden.

The code must be uploaded to the portal and GitHub and be in Python Notebook format (.ipynb file). The GitHub link is to be attached. The repository has to be open.

Evaluation will be done on the code formatting, the final accuracy results, and small explanations of any data preprocessing done (data preprocessing and visualization has bonus points). The explanations must also be included in the same python notebook which can be done using markdown cells.

The Python version to be used must be above 3.5.
Unsupervised Learning
Implement the K-Means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis algorithms from scratch in Python using Numpy and Pandas and Matplotlib for visualization.

The algorithm must be implemented as a function with arguments (dataset). Usage of any library that has an implementation is forbidden. 

The last column, Species needs to be removed before giving it as argument to the function. The column needs to stored in another variable for future comparison.

For Principal Component Analysis, the data (without Species column) must be plotted in the first three eigenvectors and the eigenvalues for the corresponding values should also be noted. 

In clustering, two plots one showing the output of the cluster and one showing actual species should be displayed. 

The code must be uploaded to the portal and GitHub and be in Python Notebook format (.ipynb file). The GitHub link is to be attached. The repository has to be open.

Evaluation will be done on the code formatting, the final accuracy results, and small explanations of any data preprocessing done (data preprocessing and visualization has bonus points). The explanations must also be included in the same python notebook which can be done using markdown cells.

The Python version to be used must be above 3.5.
